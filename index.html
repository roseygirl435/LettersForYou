/* ==================== WELCOME ==================== */
{
title:"Hello Hello 💖",
text:`Hi my love,

If you’re here right now,
it means somehow, in this busy world,
you still chose me.
You chose my heart.
And that makes me smile in ways I can’t explain.

This little world is made only for you, jaan.
Every word here, every feeling, every thought
has your name hidden inside it.
It’s my safe place… and I hope it becomes yours too.

Whenever life feels heavy,
whenever you’re tired, confused, or quiet,
whenever you don’t feel like talking to anyone…
come here.
Come to me.

I’ll listen.
I’ll understand.
Ap maante ho na, I’m always on your side.

Even when I’m not physically there,
my heart is holding yours.
Cheering for you.
Praying for you.
Missing you a little extra.

I’m always waiting for you, my luv.
With open arms.
With soft thoughts.
With so much love. 💗
Rawrrrr💕💕💕💕💕

Always yours,
Your Penguin 💕`
},

/* ==================== WHY I MADE THIS ==================== */
{
title:"Why I Made This 💌",
text:`My LUV,

I made this for you
because some days are really hard.
Because sometimes you smile outside
but inside you’re tired, quiet, or hurting.

I made this because distance hurts, baby.
Because not being able to hold your hand,
not hearing your voice whenever I want,
not seeing you when I miss you…
it breaks my heart a little every day.

I made this because you matter to me.
More than you probably realize.
More than I know how to explain in words.
THE MOST!!!

I wanted you to have a place
where you always feel safe,
always feel understood,
always feel loved…
even when I’m not around.

Whenever you feel lonely,
whenever you doubt yourself,
whenever life feels too heavy,
come here, okay?
Come to me.

This is my hug in digital form. 🫂
My way of holding you from far away.
My way of whispering,
“I’m here. I’m yours. And I’m not going anywhere.”

I love you, luv
ALWAYS. 💗`
},

/* ==================== WHEN YOU ARE TIRED ==================== */
{
title:"When You Are Tired 😴",
text:`My Heart,

I see you.
I see how hard you try every single day.
I see how much responsibility, pressure, and worry
you carry silently on your shoulders.

Sometimes you don’t complain.
Sometimes you just say, “I’m fine,”
even when you’re exhausted inside.
You know this… I notice that.

You don’t have to be strong every day, my pyara balak.
You don’t have to prove anything to anyone.
Not to the world.
Not even to me.

So please…
Rest when your body asks you to.
Breathe when your mind feels crowded.
Close your eyes and remember
that someone loves you deeply.

And that someone is me. 💗

I’m so proud of you.
For trying.
For not giving up.
For being you.

No matter what,
I’m always standing beside you.
Holding your hand.
Cheering for you.

Always. 💕`
},

/* ==================== WHEN YOU MISS ME ==================== */
{
title:"When You Miss Me 💭",
text:`My Baby,

If you’re missing me right now,
maybe it’s late.
Maybe you’re alone with your thoughts.
Maybe something reminded you of me.

So close your eyes for a moment, jaan.
Take a deep breath.
And imagine me sitting beside you,
holding your hand,
resting my head on your shoulder.

Feel my heart next to yours.
Feel how it still beats for you,
no matter how far we are.

Distance is temporary, my love.
These days apart will pass.
These empty spaces will fill again.
One day, we won’t have to say “I miss you” so much.

But my love for you?
That is permanent.
That is forever.
That never takes a break.

Even when I’m busy.
Even when I’m quiet.
Even when we don’t talk much.
I’m still thinking of you.

I miss you too, jaan.
More than I show.
More than I say.
Every single day. 💖

Always yours,
Your girl 💕`

/* ==================== WHEN YOU CAN'T SLEEP ==================== */
{
title:"When You Can’t Sleep 🌙",
text:`My Pwetty Panda Ji,

If you’re awake right now,
staring at the ceiling,
lost in thoughts you didn’t invite…
I know how that feels.

Sometimes your mind doesn’t want to rest,
even when your body is tired.
Sometimes worries, memories, and “what ifs”
keep coming quietly.

It’s okay, baby.
It’s okay to stop thinking for a while.
It’s okay to let everything go… just for tonight.

Imagine me lying beside you.
My hand in yours.
My fingers playing with your hair.
My voice low and soft near your ear.

I’m whispering to you…

You’re safe.
You’re loved.
You’re doing your best.
And that is enough.

Nothing bad is going to happen.
You don’t have to fight alone.
I’m right here. Always.

So close your eyes now, my love.
Let your heart rest.
Let your soul breathe.

Sleep peacefully. 💗
I’ll be in your dreams. 💫

Always yours,
Your baby 💕`

/* ==================== WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY ==================== */
{
title:"When You’re Angry 💢",
text:`My 2 yr old balak,

I know life hurts sometimes.
I know people disappoint you.
I know situations feel unfair.
And I know you keep a lot inside.

Sometimes the anger comes suddenly,
like a storm in your heart.
Sometimes you don’t even want to talk.
You just want everything to stop.

It’s okay, jaan.
Your feelings are real.
Your frustration matters.

But please…
Breathe with me for a moment.
Pause.
Put your hand on your heart
and remember who you are.

Don’t let anger steal your softness.
Don’t let it take away
your kindness, your patience, your beautiful soul.

That softness is what makes you you.
That’s what I fell in love with.
Soft spoken and responsible balak💗.

No matter what happened,
no matter who hurt you,
I’m on your side.
Not sometimes.
Not only on good days.

Always. 💖

With you,
Through every mood,
Every storm,
Every silence.

Your Manshi 💕`

/* ==================== WHEN YOU FEEL LONELY ==================== */
{
title:"When You Feel Lonely 🌧️",
text:`My Nakhre Wali Pretty Princess,

If you’re feeling lonely right now,
even when people are around you…
I know that kind of loneliness.
The one that sits quietly in your heart.

Sometimes you laugh.
Sometimes you talk.
Sometimes you act normal.
But inside, you feel empty.
Disconnected.
Unseen.

Baby, listen to me…
You are never alone.
Not today.
Not on your worst days.
Not on your quiet days.
Not ever.

My heart is always with you.
In every breath you take.
In every prayer I whisper.
In every thought that randomly becomes about you.

Even when we’re not talking.
Even when there’s silence.
Even when miles are between us…
I’m still holding you.

I’m holding your worries.
Your fears.
Your tiredness.
Your tears you don’t show.

Whenever you feel this way,
close your eyes and come to me.
Let me be your comfort.
Let me be your home.

I’m yours.
Completely.
And you’re so loved. 🫂💗

Always,
Your girl 💕`
},

/* ==================== WHEN I CAN'T REPLY ==================== */
{
title:"When I Can’t Answer 📱",
text:`My Pyaale Balak,

If someday I don’t reply fast,
if my messages come late,
if you’re waiting and checking your phone…
please don’t overthink, jaan.

It never means I forgot you.
It never means you’re less important.
It never means my feelings changed.

Sometimes life gets busy.
Sometimes I’m stuck in work, family, or thoughts.
Sometimes I’m tired and quiet.

But even then…
you’re still in my heart.
You’re still in my mind.
You’re still my first thought.

I always come back.
With the same love.
With the same care.
With the same “I miss you” hidden inside.

Because no matter how busy I am,
no matter where I am…
my heart knows only one place.

You. 💗

Always yours,
Your Princess 💕`

/* ==================== WHEN I HURT YOU ==================== */
{
title:"When I Hurt You 💔",
text:`My Pretty Princess,

If I ever hurt you…
with my words,
with my silence,
with my mood,
with my mistakes, 
or with my mood swings…
I’m truly sorry, jaan.

I never want to be the reason
your smile fades.
I never want to be the reason
your heart feels heavy.

Sometimes I say things without thinking.
Sometimes I react emotionally.
Sometimes I don’t express myself well.
But please know…
I never mean to hurt you.

Your feelings matter to me.
So much.
More than my ego.
More than being “right.”
More than winning an argument.

If something hurts you,
I want to know.
I want to understand.
Not to defend myself…
but to become better for you.

Let me fix it.
Let me learn.
Let me grow.
Let me love you in the way you deserve.

Because I love you too much
to lose you over pride, anger, or silence. ❤️
You are precious to me.
You are my person.

Always trying to be better,
For you,
Yours Forever 💕`
},

/* ==================== WHEN WE FIGHT ==================== */
{
title:"When We Fight 💢",
text:`My Life Support System,

If we ever fight…
if voices get quiet,
if messages become cold,
if there’s distance between us for a while…
please remember this, jaan.

It’s never you vs me.
Never.
It has always been us vs the problems.
Us trying to understand each other.
Us learning.
Us growing.

Sometimes we get emotional.
Sometimes we misunderstand.
Sometimes we say things we don’t mean.
We’re human.
We’re learning.

But no argument,
no mistake,
no bad day
is ever bigger than my love for you.

Even when I’m upset,
I still care.
I still worry.
I still miss you.

I don’t want silence.
I don’t want distance.
I want you.
With all your moods, flaws, and feelings.

So please…
don’t walk away in anger.
Don’t think I stopped loving you.

Come back to me, my love. 💗
Let’s talk.
Let’s hold hands.
Let’s choose each other again.

Always choosing us,
Your girl 💕`
},

/* ==================== WHEN YOU FEEL IGNORED ==================== */
{
title:"When You Feel Ignored 👀",
text:`My Nadaan Panda,

If you ever feel unseen…
if you feel like I’m distracted,
busy, or not listening enough…
please tell me, jaan.

Don’t keep it inside.
Don’t think you’re being dramatic.
Don’t think your feelings don’t matter.

They matter.
You matter.
So much.

Sometimes I get caught up in things.
Sometimes I reply late.
Sometimes I don’t realize
that you needed more from me in that moment.

But I never, ever want to miss your heart.
I never want you to feel like
you’re asking for too much.

With me, you are allowed to want attention.
You are allowed to want time.
You are allowed to want love.

Because you are my priority.
Not only when it’s easy.
Not only when I’m free.

Always. 💖

You’re important to me.
More than you know.

Your GURRL 💕`

If someday a small doubt comes into your heart…
if you start wondering,
“Does she still love me?”
“Am I still important to her?”
“Do I still matter?”
please come here and read this, jaan.

Yes, I love you.
Not just when things are perfect.
Not just when we’re happy.
Even on hard days.

Yes, you matter.
Your dreams.
Your fears.
Your insecurities.
Your whole heart.

Yes, I choose you.
Again and again.
Even when it’s difficult.
Even when I’m tired.
Even when life is confusing.

I don’t love you out of habit.
I love you with intention.
With feeling.
With my whole soul.

Every day, I wake up and choose you.
Every night, I fall asleep thinking of you.
And tomorrow… I’ll do it again.

Forever. ❤️

Always yours,
